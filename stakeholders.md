# Stakeholders and business value
## Target audience
Because the core idea of the project was that the imaginary betting site would like to increase the number of the live-bets during Formula 1 races, the audience must be people who are involved in sales, marketing, and business strategy within the betting industry. They would be interested in understanding how live data can influence betting behavior and how to leverage this data to maximize revenue. Since the technological background is given (like we can bet live during the races), the focus is on the business side, not on the technological one. Moreover, we can join this analysis with other possible offers like cash-out opportunities before the end of the race.

The primary target audience for this project includes:
 - sales teams
 - marketing analysts
 - business strategists
 - project management

 ## Business value
 As I wrote above, the business value of this project lies in its potential to enhance live betting experiences during Formula 1 races, so this data pipeline helps to collect user actitivity data both historically and in real-time. If the analysis is succesfull, then it can be build to the sales strategy like sending notifications to users when it is the best probability to use the application and by this way, the company can be more succesfull. </br>
