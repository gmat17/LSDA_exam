# Key performance indicators (KPIs)

## 1. Event-Driven Engagement Lift
This is the most critical KPI, since it measures if the dramatic moments during a race have any effect to the user acitivity on the betting platform, or does it effect only the social media platforms?

## 2. Opportunity Window
It determines when the notification should be sent to users during a Formula 1 race. What's the point on the race, when it should be the best to notify users about this possibility.

## 3. Event Impact Efficiency
Which type of events (overtakes, pit stops, safety car deployments, etc.) have the most significant impact on user engagement? This KPI helps to prioritize which events to focus on for notifications.
